1. Create a pod ubuntu-sleeper 
    * image - ubuntu
    * name - ubuntu-sleeper
    * start command - sleep 5000
    * User: 1000

2. Check if we can set date in ubuntu-sleeper


3. Update pod 'ubuntu-sleeper' to run as Root user and with the 'SYS_TIME' capability.

4. Now check again if we are allowed to set date now?
